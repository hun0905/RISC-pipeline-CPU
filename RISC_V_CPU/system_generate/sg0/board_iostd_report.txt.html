Key to notes and warnings:
N1: IO standards assigned technology default
N2: IO standards assigned by user
N3: IO standards assigned internally (for example, based on TDM)
N4: IO standards assigned based IO standards required or set on connected pins
N5: IO standards assigned based voltage regions
N6: The IO bank uses multiple different IO standards
